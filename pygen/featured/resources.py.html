                        <p>With the Gamedev@IU's second year fast approaching, we have finally launched the <a href="/resources.html" target="_blank">Resources</a> section of our website!
Here you can find a hand-picked collection of tutorials, articles, YouTube channels, and more focused on a wide variety of topics in game development.</p>
<p>All resources are compiled by Gamedev@IU members, and each has a short description explaining what it is and why you might find it useful.
With topics ranging from game engine fundamentals to music theory, we're hoping this collection can serve as a reliable source of valuable information for new developers and veterans alike.</p>
<p>We'll be pushing to get lots more resources added during the coming year, so be sure to check back every now and again to learn something new!</p>
