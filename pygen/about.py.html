            </div>
            <div class="bottom content outline">
                Gamedev@IU is a student-run organization at Indiana University that promotes and facilitates individual
                development of skills related to all aspects of game development.
                <br /><br />
                With a wide variety of activities, hosted by both the organization as a whole as well as member-led
                Special Interest Groups, GD@IU aims to provide a platform for students
                to learn about the medium of games, their creation, and the industry behind them.
                <br /><br />
                In addition to Special Interest Groups, the GD@IU Design/Prototype Lab offers opportunities for
                experimentation and valuable hands-on experience through workshops and small projects.

                <h2>GD@IU SIGs</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="bottom content outline">
                In addition to events and activities hosted by Gamedev@IU as a whole, members are able to join a number
                of Special Interest Groups (SIGs) focused on particular areas within the field of game development.
                These groups offer more focused opportunities to learn through workshops and guest discussions, as well
                as practice skills through a wide variety of individual and collaborative projects.
                <br /><br />
                The current set of SIGs includes Game Design, Visual Arts, Music and Sound Design, Game Technologies,
                Narrative Design, and the Games Industry.
                Beyond this, any member is able to propose and lead new SIGs focused on the areas theyâ€™re most
                passionate about.
