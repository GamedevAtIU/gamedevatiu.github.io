                        <p>Our second guest speaker event will feature Bloomington-based boardgame and escape room designer Adam Stichter,
who will be presenting <em>"Designing a Card Game from Start to Finish: Iteration, Playtesting, and Production"</em>.
He'll discuss a whole-process overview of his latest card game, covering aspects such as prototyping, iterating
based on player feedback, and the logistics of bringing the game to market.</p>
<p>GD@IU will also be holding a brownbag roundtable on independent design work with Adam at 5PM on working as an independent designer.
The location is still being decided, so be sure to keep an eye on <a href="https://iu-games.slack.com" target="_blank">Slack</a> for more info.</p>
