                        <p>Gamedev@IU has a full-organization meeting most Thursdays where members split off into groups focused on various areas of game development.
Each group will hold its own demos, workshops, projects, and more!
Come stop by to learn new skills, explore different aspects of gamedev, or just chat with fellow student developers.</p>
<p>Currently, GD@IU has groups focusing on <strong>Game Design</strong>, <strong>Game Technology</strong>, <strong>Visual Arts</strong>, <strong>Sound Design & Music</strong>, <strong>Narrative Design</strong>, and <strong>the Games Industry</strong>.</p>
<p>If you want to know what's going on each week, be sure to join the #gdiu channel in the <a href="https://iu-games.slack.com" target="_blank">IU Game Design Slack</a>!</p>
